What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	We create a local file wich stores the links to the files related to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	it offers kind of a buffer were we can select which files from the working directory are going to be commited. It offers the ability to chunk the commit depending on the logical changes.
