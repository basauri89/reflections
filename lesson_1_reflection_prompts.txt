What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For concurrency, there might be more than a person editing the same piece of code

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can learn from your own bugs, everyone tends to make the same mistakes so it is good to have a way to look back in time and learn about them

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

    Pros are that you don’t create useless versions. cons are that you might lose some information if you don’t commit often.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
    
    Because normally docs are not related, however git was created for coding, which means that a change in one file affects some others. thus, git allows saving multiple files at once.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I need to go into the folder with the files which have been edited and use the terminal to first check the log : git log. Secondly, I can copy the commit id and do git diff and compare both commits in order to see what changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    You will be able to checkout a previous version so no damage will be dealt to the app.
